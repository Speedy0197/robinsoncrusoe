Release:
* 6 Cards of each category
* 4 Characters, one ability each
* 2 Side-Characters
* Functioning Board
* Free Camera (maybe too free)
* Tutorial / Trailer
* Probably still buggy, leave a note if you find anything

The actual board game is still our role model, but we had to adjust a few rules to make it playable for friday.
Feel free to test it out
